# MIAO (Âñµ) ch552t MCU board

### Changelog
2023-09-29 initial commit  
2023-09-30 fixed pinout to correspond to Xiao, added jumper to choose between RX/CS on pin 8, completely rerouted

| :zap: The hardware design is tested and confirmed working as of the latest commit. Nevertheless I cannot guarantee anything. **Use at your own risk!** |

## About
MIAO is a cheap and hand-solderable drop-in replacement for the Seeeduino Xiao series.  
(Castellated holes are expensive, so MIAO doesn't support them [for now].)

Âñµ is the Hanzi for "miƒÅo", which is Mandarin for "meow".

# Features
MIAO features:
- Utilizes wch's ch552t microcontroller, which at the time of writing costs a few dozen cents! 
- SPI and UART pins in the same places as Xiao (use jumper to choose between RX/CS on pin 8)
- 2 Analogue pins
- 4 additional broken out pins (not pads!) compared to the Xiao boards:
  - 2 free GPIOs
  - reset pin (pull HIGH for reset)
  - boot pin (pull HIGH for entering bootloader)
- Full ESD protection incl. protection against reverse current and overcurrent
- Top-mount USB port for maximum drop-in-ability
- Optional power or user led (on the backside; bridge left and middle part of jumper for always-on, middle and right for user controllable via P3.3)
- Optional reset and bootloader buttons (on the backside)
- Optional footprint for connecting USB Shield to GND in a way that fits your application
- Cute pixel cat on the back! üê±
